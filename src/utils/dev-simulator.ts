First, I need to understand what you're asking for.
You want me to demonstrate the thinking process.

This is the actual content that appears after the thinking phase. It demonstrates how the interface handles the transition from thoughts to the main response.

The key points are:
1. Thoughts appear first with a thinking indicator
2. Content starts streaming after thoughts complete
3. The UI should scroll appropriately to keep content visible
4. No layout jumps should occur during transitions

Let me think about how to structure this comprehensive test:

- Each section should test different aspects of the rendering system
- I should include code blocks to test syntax highlighting
- Lists and tables will help verify formatting preservation
- Performance testing sections with repetitive content
- Mixed content types to ensure everything works together

This thinking phase itself is designed to last approximately 2 seconds with the current streaming settings. The thoughts are being displayed while I prepare the extensive content that follows. This helps test the transition from thinking to content generation, ensuring smooth scrolling and no visual glitches during the switch.

I'll make sure to include enough variety in the content to thoroughly test:
1. Text wrapping and paragraph formatting
2. Markdown rendering for headers and emphasis
3. Code block syntax highlighting
4. List formatting (both ordered and unordered)
5. Table rendering with multiple rows
6. Quote blocks and nested content
7. Performance with very long streaming sessions

    content: `# Very Long Streaming Test Response

This is an extensive response designed to test how the application handles very long streaming output. It will include multiple sections, various formatting elements, and enough content to thoroughly test the streaming, rendering, and scrolling behaviors.

## Section 1: Introduction to Long Content

${Array(10)
  .fill(0)
  .map(
    (_, i) =>
      `Paragraph ${i + 1}: This is a substantial paragraph containing detailed information about various topics. It includes multiple sentences to ensure that the content is meaningful and tests the text wrapping behavior properly. The streaming should handle this smoothly without any performance degradation or visual glitches. Each paragraph adds to the overall length of the response, helping us verify that the UI remains responsive even with large amounts of content.`,
  )
  .join('\n\n')}

## Section 2: Technical Details

Let's explore some technical concepts with detailed explanations:

### Subsection 2.1: Architecture Patterns

${Array(5)
  .fill(0)
  .map(
    (_, i) =>
      `**Pattern ${i + 1}**: This architectural pattern involves multiple components working together in a coordinated manner. The implementation requires careful consideration of various factors including scalability, maintainability, and performance. When properly implemented, this pattern provides significant benefits in terms of code organization and system reliability.`,
  )
  .join('\n\n')}

### Subsection 2.2: Code Examples

Here are several code examples to test syntax highlighting with long content:

\`\`\`javascript
// Example 1: Complex async operation
async function performComplexOperation(data) {
  console.log('Starting complex operation...');
  
  try {
    const preprocessed = await preprocessData(data);
    const validated = validateInput(preprocessed);
    
    if (!validated.isValid) {
      throw new Error('Validation failed: ' + validated.errors.join(', '));
    }
    
    const results = await Promise.all([
      processPartA(validated.data),
      processPartB(validated.data),
      processPartC(validated.data)
    ]);
    
    return combineResults(results);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Operation failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
\`\`\`

\`\`\`python
# Example 2: Data processing pipeline
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self, config: Dict):
        self.config = config
        self.pipeline = []
        
    def add_step(self, step_function):
        """Add a processing step to the pipeline"""
        self.pipeline.append(step_function)
        return self
        
    def process(self, data: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Execute the processing pipeline"""
        result = data.copy()
        
        for i, step in enumerate(self.pipeline):
            print(f"Executing step {i + 1}: {step.__name__}")
            result = step(result)
            
        return result
\`\`\`

## Section 3: Lists and Enumerations

### Ordered Lists

${Array(20)
  .fill(0)
  .map(
    (_, i) =>
      `${i + 1}. List item number ${i + 1}: This is a detailed list item that contains enough text to wrap to multiple lines, ensuring that the list formatting is preserved correctly even with long content. The numbering should remain consistent throughout.`,
  )
  .join('\n')}

### Unordered Lists

${Array(15)
  .fill(0)
  .map(
    (_, i) =>
      `- Bullet point ${i + 1}: Another extensive bullet point with detailed information that tests the rendering of unordered lists with wrapped text content.`,
  )
  .join('\n')}

## Section 4: Tables and Data

| Column A | Column B | Column C | Column D | Column E |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
${Array(25)
  .fill(0)
  .map(
    (_, i) =>
      `| Data ${i}A | Data ${i}B | Data ${i}C | Data ${i}D | Data ${i}E |`,
  )
  .join('\n')}

## Section 5: Mathematical Content

Here are some mathematical expressions and explanations:

${Array(10)
  .fill(0)
  .map(
    (_, i) =>
      `**Equation ${i + 1}**: When we consider the relationship between variables x and y, we can express it as y = mx + b where m represents the slope and b represents the y-intercept. This linear relationship is fundamental to many mathematical and scientific applications.`,
  )
  .join('\n\n')}

## Section 6: Quoted Content

${Array(8)
  .fill(0)
  .map(
    (_, i) =>
      `> Quote ${i + 1}: "This is a substantial quote that contains philosophical or technical insights. It's long enough to test how the application handles quoted text that spans multiple lines. The formatting should be preserved throughout the streaming process."`,
  )
  .join('\n\n')}

## Section 7: Mixed Content Types

Let's combine different content types to test complex rendering:

### Step-by-step Tutorial

${Array(15)
  .fill(0)
  .map(
    (_, i) =>
      `**Step ${i + 1}**: Detailed instructions for this step, including:
- Prerequisite A for this step
- Prerequisite B for this step
- Important consideration to keep in mind

\`\`\`bash
# Command for step ${i + 1}
command --option value --flag
\`\`\`

Expected output: The system should respond with confirmation that step ${i + 1} has been completed successfully.
`,
  )
  .join('\n')}

## Section 8: Performance Testing Content

${Array(50)
  .fill(0)
  .map(
    (_, i) =>
      `Performance test paragraph ${i + 1}: ${Array(10)
        .fill(0)
        .map(() => 'This sentence tests streaming performance.')
        .join(' ')}`,
  )
  .join('\n\n')}

## Conclusion

This extensive response has tested various aspects of the streaming system:
- Long content streaming without performance degradation
- Proper scrolling behavior as content streams
- Syntax highlighting in code blocks
- Various markdown formatting elements
- List rendering with many items
- Table formatting
- Mixed content types

The streaming should have completed smoothly, and all content should be properly rendered and accessible. The UI should remain responsive throughout the entire streaming process, and users should be able to scroll through all the content without any issues.
